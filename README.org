* Docker build for vrn code

This is intended to work on CPU. Will modify eventually to have CUDA
support. It's available on DockerHub but you are welcome to build it
yourself too.

** Setup

*** Dockerhub

#+BEGIN_SRC
sudo docker pull asjackson/vrn:latest
#+END_SRC

*** Build docker manually

You will need Git LFS extension to download the models.

#+BEGIN_SRC
git clone
cd vrn-docker
sudo docker build -t vrn .
#+END_SRC

** Running the container

An example image of Alan Turing is available in the folder ~data~,
this needs to be bind mounted to ~/data~ in the container. With any
luck, ~data/turing.jpg.obj~ will be created.

#+BEGIN_SRC
sudo docker run -v $(pwd)/data:/data:Z vrn /runner/run.sh /data/turing.jpg
#+END_SRC
